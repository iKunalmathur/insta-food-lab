# insta-food-lab

Instagram for food lovers. (sounds clich√©? I know)

## Stories

- User can sign up or sign in with simple steps
- User can update Profile with name, bio, contact
- User can post food pictures (multiple) along with the name, description, price, geo-location (optional), and set rating out of 5
- Users can like or dislike posts
- Users can add or remove comments
- User can follow or unfollow other users
- User Feed

## Technicality

- Using react as frontend with tailwind css
- Using laravel as the backend with Mongodb
- OTP Login
- RESTful API
- Custom Auth
- Use laravel advance features
- Naming convention for react should be Camel Case (ex. firstName, lastName)
- Naming convention for laravel should be Snake Case (ex. first_name, last_name) for more info (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/programming-naming-conventions-explained)
- The UI should be simple and soft, like the lovechild of Instagram and Zomato.
